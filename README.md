Brain Tumor Classification using Deep Learning

📌 Overview

This project focuses on Brain Tumor Classification using Deep Learning. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is trained on MRI scan images to classify whether a brain tumor is present.

🚀 Features

Uses Deep Learning (CNNs) for image classification

Implemented in Google Colab

Uses TensorFlow/Keras for model training

Includes data preprocessing, augmentation, and visualization

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

Google Colab

TensorFlow/Keras

OpenCV

Matplotlib & Seaborn

📂 Dataset

The dataset consists of MRI scans labeled as Tumor and Non-Tumor.

If the dataset is public, add a link here.

If private, explain how to access it.
